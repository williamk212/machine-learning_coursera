function idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)
%FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS computes the centroid memberships for every example
%   idx = FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS (X, centroids) returns the closest centroids
%   in idx for a dataset X where each row is a single example. idx = m x 1 
%   vector of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K])
%

% Set K
K = size(centroids, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
idx = zeros(size(X,1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
%               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
%               Concretely, idx(i) should contain the index of the centroid
%               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
%               range 1..K
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the examples to compute this.
%
[Xm, Xn] = size(X);
% printf("size X: %ix%i\n", Xm, Xn);
[cm, cn] = size(centroids);
% printf("size centroid: %ix%i\n", cm, cn);

% * create a "distance" matrix of size (m x K) and initialize it to all zeros. 'm' is the number of training examples, K is the number of centroids.
% * Use a for-loop over the 1:K centroids.
% * Inside this loop, create a column vector of the distance from each training 
%   example to that centroid, and store it as a column of the distance matrix.
%   One method is to use the sum() function and the bsxfun() function to calculate 
%   the sum of the squares of the differences between each row in the X matrix
%   and a centroid.
% * When the for-loop ends, you'll have a matrix of centroid distances.
% * Then return idx as the vector of the indexes of the locations with the
%   minimum distance. The result is a vector of size (m x 1) with the indexes
%   of the closest centroids.

% quick tutorial on bsxfun()
% bsxfun() applies a function on a matrix with a vector
% ex: A = [1 2 10; 1 4 20;1 6 15] ;
%     C = bsxfun(@minus, A, mean(A))
% result:
%   0 -2 -5
%   0  0  5
%   0  2  0
% where mean(A): 1 4 15

distance = zeros(Xm, K);
for i = 1:K
  diff = bsxfun(@minus, X, centroids(i,:));
  % do a sum with DIM=2: this creates the sum per row instead of col
  distance(:,i) = sum(diff.^2, 2);
end
[min_dist, idx] = min(distance, [], 2);
